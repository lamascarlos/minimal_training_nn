# minimal_training_nn

Basic codes for train a feed forward neural network with sinthetic data. After the training, the NN is able to classify magnetic phases of the Ising model on the square lattice.

## Files

minimal.py contains the functions used in the main code

mn_git.ipynb is the main file where the NN is defined, trained and evaluated on Montecarlo data.
